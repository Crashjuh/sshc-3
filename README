# README - sshc
#

sshc is a perl script capable of executing commands across groups of hosts.

It is meant to be simple and compact. There are no dependencies on external
perl modules. All the code is contained in a single source file, and 
configuration is read from a single rc file in the user's home directory.


USAGE

  % sshc
  usage: sshc user cluster_name command
    i.e. sshc username clustername "uname -a"


INSTALLATION

  To get started, simply place sshc in your path, copy sshcrc.sample to 
  ~/.sshcrc, and add your cluster/host names.

  That's it.


EXAMPLE

  % cat ~/.sshcrc
  aws
  pluto.aws.foo
  jupiter.aws.foo


  % sshc pchuck aws "uptime ; uname -a"

  Cluster 'aws' contains 2 hosts. [pchuck] executing commands.. 

  [0] pluto.aws.foo> uptime ; uname -a
    13:00:48 up 69 days, 15:35,  0 users,  load average: 0.00, 0.00, 0.00
    Linux pluto.aws.foo 2.6.18-238.9.1.el5xen #1 SMP Tue Apr 12 19:32:47 
    EDT 2011 i686 i686 i386 GNU/Linux
  [1] jupiter.aws.foo> uptime ; uname -a
    13:00:49 up 26 days, 14:35,  0 users,  load average: 0.82, 0.73, 0.75
